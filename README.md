# Demand-Based Surge Pricing System
This project simulates demand based surge pricing used in ride hailing platforms.

## Features
- Identifies high demand locations (hotspots)
- Applies surge pricing based on demand
- Calculates final ride fare using distance and time inputs

## Technical Stack
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Assumptions & Scope
- Base fare, per-kilometer, and per-minute charges are assumed and configurable
- Surge pricing is applied using a fixed multiplier for hotspot locations
- Demand is calculated from a limited, simulated set of ride requests
- The system is a simplified simulation and does not use real time data
